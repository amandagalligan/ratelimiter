# ratelimiter
Example Token bucket algorithm in golang

# How does it work?
- Whenever a request comes it sees if there are any tokens in the bucket
- If there arenâ€™t any tokens, we throttle the request by returning 429 (too many requests) to the user
- If the bucket is not empty then the request takes up one of the tokens and proceeds ahead.
- At every refill rate interval new tokens - tokensPerInterval are added so that final number of tokens in the bucket would be min(current_tokens+tokensPerInterval, bucket_size)
